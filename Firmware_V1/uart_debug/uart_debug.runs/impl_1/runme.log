Phase 2.1.2 IO & Clk Clean Up
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	button_IBUF_BUFG[3]_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y4
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (BUFC-1) Input Buffer Connections - Input buffer btn_rst_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (BUFC-1) Input Buffer Connections - Input buffer button[1]_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (BUFC-1) Input Buffer Connections - Input buffer button[2]_IBUF_inst has no loads. An input buffer must drive an internal load.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (CFGBVS-1) Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties - Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net encoder_inst/data_out_reg[7]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin encoder_inst/data_out_reg[7]_i_2/O, cell encoder_inst/data_out_reg[7]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net top_decoder_inst/delay_inst_trig_enc/CLK is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin top_decoder_inst/delay_inst_trig_enc/cnt[3]_i_1__0/O, cell top_decoder_inst/delay_inst_trig_enc/cnt[3]_i_1__0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT top_decoder_inst/delay_inst_trig_enc/cnt[3]_i_1__0 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    top_decoder_inst/pin_ctrl_r_reg[0] {FDRE}
    top_decoder_inst/pin_ctrl_r_reg[1] {FDRE}
    top_decoder_inst/pin_ctrl_l_reg[0] {FDRE}
    top_decoder_inst/pin_ctrl_l_reg[1] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (RPBF-3) IO port buffering is incomplete - Device port mode expects both input and output buffering but the buffers are incomplete.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (RTSTAT-10) No routable loads - 3 net(s) have no routable loads. The problem bus(es) and/or net(s) are btn_rst_IBUF, button[1]_IBUF, button[2]_IBUF.
